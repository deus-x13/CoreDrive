Core Drive Framework: Contextual Summary for App Development
Version: 1.1
Date: August 7, 2025
Status: Finalized for Phase 1 Development

This document provides the necessary context for an AI to develop a survey and reporting application based on the Core Drive framework.

Core Concepts
Objective: The primary goal of the framework is to identify what motivates people at work to enable leaders and teams to create environments that align with those drivers. This leads to improved communication, empathy, performance, and a more meaningful work experience.

-----

Theoretical Foundation: The framework is informed by established psychological theories, including Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, and Self-Determination Theory (SDT).

-----

Core Components: The framework consists of 10 primary motivators that participants rank based on their importance in a professional setting. The motivators are categorized as either 

Intrinsic (internal drivers like Purpose) or Extrinsic (external factors like Flexibility).
-----
Application Requirements
The application should guide a user through a survey and then generate insightful reports based on the collected data.

1. The Survey
The app needs to present a survey where users rank motivators and answer qualitative and demographic questions, all within the context of their professional lives.

Survey Questions:

Ranking Question: The user must rank the 10 core motivators in order of personal importance at work. The motivators are: Autonomy, Belonging, Collaboration, Dependability, Flexibility, Growth, Impact, Psychological Safety, Purpose, and Recognition.

Qualitative Questions

Please share why you have ranked your top 3 motivators in the way you did. 

Is there a motivator that’s important to you but wasn’t included in the list above? If yes, please describe it and where it would rank. 

How well do your top motivators show up in your current role? 

Has anything changed (in your role, team, or environment) in the past 3 months that affected how motivated you feel? 

What could help you feel more motivated at work right now? 

Demographic Questions:

Generational Group (Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, Baby Boomer).

Role, Function, Industry, and Country.

2. The Reporting Engine
The app must generate three types of reports by synthesizing quantitative rankings with qualitative comments.

Individual Report: For the respondent, visualizing their ranked motivators and summarizing their qualitative answers to foster self-reflection.

Team Report: An aggregated, anonymized report for leaders/HR showing the team's collective motivational patterns. This includes identifying potential "hygiene factor risks."

Clarification on Hygiene Factor Risks: This term refers to when a foundational, extrinsic motivator (like Dependability) is ranked low by many team members. This does not mean the organization performs poorly in that area; rather, it indicates the team is not actively motivated by it and may be taking it for granted. The "risk" is that the absence of this factor would cause significant dissatisfaction.

Leader/HR/OD Guide: A strategic guide that translates the team's data into actionable advice, including leadership behaviors, communication strategies, and culture-building activities.

Potential Refinements for Future Versions (Phase 2 Consideration)
The following are optional enhancements to the qualitative questions to yield even more specific, story-based answers for a richer Design Thinking analysis.

Refinement to Question 4:

Make the question more specific by dynamically inserting the user's top-ranked motivator.

Example: "Thinking of your #1 motivator, [App dynamically inserts the user's top-ranked motivator here], can you share a recent example of when you felt it was supported or blocked at work?"

Optional New Question:

Add a forward-looking, action-oriented question to better define user goals.

Example: "If you could redesign one aspect of your job to better align with your top motivators, what would you change?"
